# UFOs


## Overview

Our client requested us to display a table to show the UFO data as a JavaScript array. We added the filter function to the website to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Results

As we see on the left side on the webpage. There are 5 filters available, which are Enter date, Enter City, Enter State,Enter Country and Enter Shape. They provide the easiness for users to search the related information.

## Summary
### Drawback
1. The information is limited as the database is relatively small.
2. Seaching engine is not powerful enough, it may have difficulty to read the spellings of searching words.

### Recommendations:
1. We can add a drop-down lists including all filter values. It can be more user-friendly.
